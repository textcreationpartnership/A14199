            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Touching the ſubſtance, it containeth matter both of mercy and of Iudgement,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.6.</note> which were the two parts wherein the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Iohn</hi> conſiſted,<note place="margin">Iſaih 5.4.</note> as it was foretold of him: ſo likewiſe here he doth faithfully execute and performe both.

                  <p>Hence two things may be noted from this Allegorie: Firſt, touching the husbandman, hee is God;<note place="margin">Iſai 5.2. Ier. 2.21.

                  <p>Touching his husbandry it is the Church ſo named in many places of Scripture, and that in diuerſe reſpects; as a vineyard hath need of planting, watering, pruning, purging, digging,<note place="margin">Pſal. 80.9.

                  <p>Hence two things may be obſerued; Firſt, that the Law muſt precede the Goſpell. Secondly, that the Goſpell is to bee conjoyned vnto the Law, and to accompany the ſame.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, the Law muſt precede the Goſpell, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Gods word muſt firſt denounce judgement out of the Law againſt ſinne,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.27.</note> before they proclaime mercies out of the Goſpell vnto ſinners; thus dealt God with <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, <hi>In that day that thou eateſt thou ſhalt die the death:</hi> ſo alſo before the giuing of the Law, there were thunders, lightnings, yea Mount <hi>Siuai</hi> was all in fire and ſmoake,<note place="margin">Iſai. 1.4.

                     <hi>the letter killeth, but the ſpirit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth life; The Law is the Ministration of condemnation; the Goſpell, the miniſtration of righteouſneſſe,</hi> couering our ſinnes, healing our diſeaſes, offering free remiſſion of ſinnes by Ieſus Chriſt, vnto all which as beleeue in him.</p>
                  <p>This ſerueth both for Exhortation and Reproofe: Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to vs, to diſtinguiſh betwixt the Law and the Goſpell, betwixt the threatnings againſt impenitent ſinners, and the promiſes vnto the penitent, that they preach the Law vnto ſuch as haue moſt neede, and the Goſpell vnto ſuch as haue moſt need of it; as alſo becauſe they cannot exactly diſtinguiſh of their hearers, therefore let both be conioyned together, that neither the penitent deſpaire by the preaching of the Law, nor the impenitent preſume by preaching of the Goſpell, vnto the people to prepare themſelues, either for threatnings or comforts, according vnto their preſent eſtate: threatnings if they are impenitent, comfort if they are caſt downe through the conſideration of their ſinnes: as alſo to be carefull in the application of Gods word, that they doe not apply the Goſpell
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15287:11"/>vnto themſelues, continuing in ſinne; neither the Law, if they truely repent them of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>This ſhould teach vs, when either preaching nothing but iudgement, or nothing but mercy; by the former terrifying Gods children, by the latter imboldning the wicked: this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth the people, which either looke ſtill for mercy, or ſtill for iudgement, and which either out of a conceit of the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their owne hearts, apply mercies vnto themſelues, and iudgement belongeth vnto them; or out of a needleſſe or wrong ſuſpicion of their owne hypocriſie, apply Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vnto themſelues, when as mercies are propounded vnto them, and they are the children of God. Thus of Method.</p>
                  <p>Touching the End why Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doth thus threaten them: It was that they might take notice of their preſent and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate, and whileſt they had time might repent, and ſo eſcape the danger. Hence this obſeruation doth ariſe:</p>
                  <p>That before God doth inflict any iudgement, he giueth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſement and warning thereof, that it may be preuented: thus he did vnto the firſt World, vnto the ſinfull Cities, vnto the <hi>Niniuites;</hi> thus did our Sauiour vnto <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> he gaue warning of that lamentable deſtruction, yea before it came to paſſe, diuers ſignes did appeare, aduertiſements for deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> doth relate: and did not God giue vs ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent warning, and aduertiſement of thoſe iudgements which of late haue fallen vpon this Land; thus doth <hi>Iohn</hi> at this time to the <hi>Pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Iohn</hi> doth this, firſt that thoſe his aduertiſements and warnings might moue vs to repentance; this effect they wrought both in wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> and likewiſe in the <hi>Niniuites:</hi> the hunter doth not diſquiet his prey, but rather waits till it reſt, that he may thruſt it through; but God doth rouſe vs vp, leaſt we be thruſt through.

                  <p>This ſerueth for Inſtruction, Exhortation, and Reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Inſtruction, to ſhew vs the truth of that excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15287:12"/>that God doth not delight in the death of a ſinner, if he were deſirous to deſtroy he needeth not to giue vs warning, but becauſe he is vnwilling we ſhould periſh, he doth giue vs admonition of our danger that we may repent.</p>

In taking to heart the iudgements threatned, let vs make vſe of our time of peace, in being zealous of Gods glory and our owne ſaluation; let vs turne to our firſt loue, from whence we are fallen, ere the Lord make a full end of vs: let vs imitate ſuch as feared the word of the Lord among the ſeruants of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>

                     <p>The Reaſons hereof are theſe. 1. The vnchangeableneſſe of his will,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reaſons.</hi> Act. 17.30.</note> 
                        <hi>with whom is no ſhadow of changing or alteration:</hi> he hath appointed a day in which he will iudge the world in righteouſneſſe; in which he will both execute both generall and particular iudgement. 2. His ability and power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what he hath decreed; many may lay downe a purpoſe and reſolution, which they are not able to bring to paſſe, but God hath decreed that he hath power to accompliſh. 3. For the comfort of Gods children, leaſt they ſhould deſpaire.</p>
                     <p>But it may be demanded, 1. whether all thoſe iudgements which are threatned ſhall certainly be accompliſhed. 2. Why the Lord doth conceale the particular time of his comming, either to iudgement or mercy. 3. Why God doth deferre to deliuer his owne children from wicked men, and doth not execute iudgement vpon them when they doe ſinne againſt him.</p>
                     <p>To the firſt I anſwer, that Gods iudgements are threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs conditionally, if we doe not repent, if we doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15287:13"/>in ſinne; otherwiſe, if we doe not repent, and forſake our ſinnes, they ſhall either not ſeaſe vpon vs at all, or otherwiſe in mercy, not in iuſtice: hence commonly they haue this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall coniunction, as annexed vnto them, if ye doe not amend; as when we intend any iourney, we vnderſtand, if it ſhall pleaſe the Lord; ſo when the Lord ſaith he will deſtroy vs, we are to take it as appertaining vnto vs, if we doe continue in our ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>To the ſecond I anſwer, that the Lord doth conceale the particular time of his comming, either vnto Iudgement or vnto Mercy, both for the triall and humiliation of his owne children, and for the furtherance of wicked men vnto repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the more vncertaine iudgements, when they ſhall come, the more ſhould theſe haſten their repentance, that they may preuent the ſame; the more, I ſay, they ſhould prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by repentance to auoid iudgements, that they may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of mercies.</p>
                     <p>To the third I anſwer, that God doth delay to execute his iudgements vpon wicked men (moſt commonly) to draw them vnto repentance; and doth deferre to deliuer his owne children from them, but that they may be truely humbled, and that they may call vpon him, acknowledging by whom they are deliuered, yea that hereby greater euils may be preuented; after which manner, the Lord for a long time did exerciſe his ſeruant <hi>Dauid,</hi> whom his faithful God did not ſuffer to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aboue that which he was able to beare, but at length deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him from them all, <hi>all things working together for the beſt to ſuch as loue God.</hi>

                     <p>For the ſecond, when the time of grace and ſaluation is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (not imbraced, then iudgements ſhall come; the people of the <hi>Iewes</hi> had a time of repentance, the miniſtery of the Law and the Prophets, now alſo haue they a time of iudgement, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they did repent) for the contempt of ſo great a mercy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: the deſtruction of the old World by the inundation of waters, for their contempt of the miniſtry of <hi>Noah;</hi> the herri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confuſion of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Moſes;</hi> the wickedneſſe of <hi>Saul</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Samuel;</hi> the contempt of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> after their deliuerance from <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> being like the Blackamoore which doth not chang his colour, or the Leopard his ſpots: and the iudgements which ſeazed vpon them, clearely confirme this point. The <hi>Iewes</hi> had many both painfull and faithfull Teachers, yet they would not imbrace the mercy offered: Chriſt the light of the world, him they did crucifie, <hi>Paul</hi> famous throughout all the world, who had preached euen from <hi>Illyricum</hi> vnto <hi>Spaine,</hi> for him they laid wait, that they might kill him, many others they had but all in

                        <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed by <hi>Titus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and the whole land of <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> at this day all groaneth vnder the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> thraldome.

                     <p>Firſt, that the judgements denounced againſt wicked men out of the word of God, are heauy, of great weight and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.

                     <p>For the third, that the miniſtery of Gods word doth fit and prepare vs either for ſaluation or damnation, may be proued by that ſpeech of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> vnto the <hi>Romanes,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the third point, the vſe of the inſtrument laid or put to the roote of the trees; noting vnto vs two things: Firſt, the propinquitie of Gods judgements: Secondly, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay which he vſeth in executing his judgements.</p>
                     <p>For the vnderſtanding of both theſe points: two things are to be obſcrued: Firſt, if the Axe, <hi>be put to the roote of the trees,</hi> why are they not cut downe? Secondly, if they bee not cut downe, why then is axe laide vnto them; or if Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be threatned, why are they not executed; and if they are not to be executed, why then are they threatned?</p>
                     <p>For anſwer vnto both: Firſt, <hi>The axe is laid to the roote of the trees:</hi> Gods judgements threatned, and yet not executed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the trees are reaſonable trees, men endued with reaſon;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15287:17"/>the rootes of theſe trees, the hearts of men, which in time may change, turne and bring forth good fruit; namely, when God by his Spirit ſhall renew their wils, and beſtow vpon them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minds to performe the actions of holineſſe: In the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of good, our wils are not actiue, but meerely paſſiue, we haue no free will vnto that which is good, wee are not onely priſoners,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.1.</note> bound with the cords of ſinne, but ſtarke dead, without any ability in our fleſh to performe any good worke, but by the operation of Gods Spirit; we are not onely deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of that originall righteouſneſſe wherein wee were created, but alſo our hearts are altogether enclined vnto euill, <hi>The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions of our hearts are euill continually:</hi> wherefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt the Papiſts, that ſeeing by nature wee want origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall righteouſneſſe, and alſo are prone vnto all euill, therefore we want free will vnto that which is good: This the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> confirmeth, <hi>The naturall man perceiueth not the things that are of the Spirit of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> 
                        <hi>for they are fooliſhneſſe vnto him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Our righteouſneſſe is in Chriſt Ieſus onely; both in reſpect of his actiue and paſſiue obedience, <hi>Through whom God doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count vs righteous,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, although the trees are not preſently cut downe, yet is the Axe laid vnto them, though Gods judgements are not preſently executed, yet are they denounced and threatned, euen that hereby we may feare our cutting downe, and in time bring forth good fruit, that ſo we may not be cut downe at all, for (as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith) although wicked men do not amend by feare,<note place="margin">Quam vis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>The obſeruations which then ariſe from the applycation of the inſtrument, laid or put to the roote of the trees are theſe. Firſt, that when Gods word is vrged and applyed to mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and by preachers laid and preſſed to the hearts of the hearers, they then behold the propinquitie of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereby they belong vnto God, they are moued to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15287:17"/>which made <hi>Dauid</hi> to ſay, <hi>I haue ſinned;</hi> and againe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 143.2.</note>

                        <hi>Ioſeph</hi> told <hi>Pharaoh that his dreame was doubled vnto him twiſe, becauſe the thing was eſtabliſhed by God, &amp; God would ſhortly bring it to paſſe, or haſten to performe it:</hi> ſo I tell thee, thou haſt need to feare when thy conſcience is informed by the word, of thoſe judgements pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the wicked.</p>
                     <p>Let my counſell bee acceptable vnto you, <hi>Breake off your ſins by righteouſneſſe, and your iniquities by ſhewing mercy vnto the poore.</hi> In time forſake your wickedneſſe,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.27.</note> ſeeing the Iudge is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to knocke at the doore, <hi>and now the Axe is laid to the roote fo the tree.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, that howſoeuer our ſins deſerue that God ſhould execute his judgements againſt vs ſo ſoone as they are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet out of his abounding loue and mercy, hee doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his judgements, and not preſently execute the ſame,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.32.</note> 
                        <hi>As I liue (ſaith the Lord) I deſire not the death of a ſinner, but that he ſhould conuert and liue. The Lord doth ſtretch out his armes all the day long, to a froward and rebellious generation:</hi>

The firſt world was ſpared for a 120. yeares, ſo <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the <hi>Iſratlits,</hi> the primatiue Church vnder <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, Germanie, France, England,</hi> but did not make the right vſe, did not turne vnto the Lord, therefore judgements came vpon them: and I pray you hath not God ſpared vs this long time, he might haue taken vs away by the ſword by the famine by the peſtilence, as many amongſt vs haue beene; but it hath pleaſed him yet to ſpare vs: judgements are threatned againſt vs, and yet where is our amendment? what vſe do we make of this time? ſinne doth now more abound amongſt vs, from the higheſt to the loweſt, then formerly it hath done; and is not this an euident token, that the ſweetneſſe of mercy ſhall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the bitterneſſe of judgement; and then wee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that in time, wee did not vſe time aright; iudgements ſhal finde vs out, howſoeuer wee may thinke to eſcape them: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> bad <hi>Moſes</hi> goe out of his fight; but iudgements ſhall not depart from vs when we would. It is Sathan that doth incite vs to neglect the opportunity of time, becauſe he gaineth by our forgetfulneſſe, therefore with <hi>Dauid</hi> wee might pray,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15287:18"/>
                        <hi>Teach vs O Lord that we may number our daies,</hi>

                        <hi>that we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie our hearts vnto wiſedome:</hi> The wicked whilſt mercy is offered, neglect this numbering, are more buſie to multiply ſin; in ſhort time become perfect ſwearers, expert drunkards, cunning deceiuers, and ſo make not right vſe of their time. In life to liue well is joyfull, to dye well is comfortable; but after an euill life to dye in impenitencie, this is moſt fearefull. To conclude this point, whilſt it is to day, let vs heare and obey; whilſt Gods iudgements do not lie vpon vs, but hang ouer our heads, let vs in the feare of God, by repentance preuent them, that they may be remoued. Thus of the application and vſe of the inſtrument.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the fourth point,<note place="margin">

                     <p>In a tree two pointes are to be noted: Firſt, that which is aboue the ground, which remaineth after the branches are cut off, commonly called a ſtocke <hi>Truncus.</hi> Secondly, that which is vnder the earth, hid and couered by the earth, firmely faſtned to the earth, both which <hi>Iob</hi> conjoyneth together, <hi>Though the roote of it waxe old in the earth, and the ſtocke thereof be dried in the ground, yet by the ſent of water it will bud.</hi> The godly and the wicked may bee compared vnto both theſe parts of the tree, though in a different reſpect.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I ſay the godly may be compared vnto that part of the tree, which is <hi>ſuper terram,</hi> aboue the ground; for as it may bud, and tender twigs may ſpring from it, although the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be cut off, euen ſo although Gods children for a time may be terrified, and as it were cut downe by Gods judgements, yet at the length they ſpring againe; or although Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for a time may ſeeme to haue the graces of Gods Spirit, decaying or dead, yet at the length they appeare as young branches out of the ſtocke, though they ſeeme cut downe, it is but onely for a time, God can againe make them to fructifie,

                        <note place="margin">Iam. 1.17.</note> vnder the earth, for as the roots are firmely ſetled and faſtned to the earth, whereby the tree is more firme and ſtedfaſt; euen ſo are Gods children, by faith firmely ſetled and faſt grounded to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, with whom is no variableneſſe,<note place="margin">Prou. 12.3.</note> nor ſhadow of changing.

                     <p>As the godly, fo the wicked may be compared both vnto that part of the tree which is aboue the ground, and that part of the tree which is vnder the ground.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I ſay the wicked may be compared vnto that part of the tree which is aboue the ground; in reſpect that part of the tree which is aboue the ground, is more ſubiect vnto danger then that part which is vnder the ground: ſo the wicked are ſubiect vnto the wrath and iudgements of God,<note place="margin">Exod. 9.31.32.</note> when as his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are free; the wicked are as the Barley and Flaxe in <hi>Egypt,</hi> whieh by the Hayle were ſmitten: whereas Gods children are as the Wheat and the Rye, they were not ſmitten,<note place="margin">Iſai. 5.24.</note> becauſe they were hid in the ground. Secondly, as that ſtocke is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the moſt rotten piece of the tree, ioyned to the duſt of the earth, and the one diſſolued into the other; ſo likewiſe the wicked which are not in Chriſt Ieſus are but durt and dung, the off-ſcouring of the world in the preſence of God, in a moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy and miſerable condition; as the flame of fire deuoureth the ſtubble (ſaith <hi>Iſaias</hi>) and as the chaffe is conſumed of the flame, ſo the root ſhall be as rottenneſſe,<note place="margin">Iſai. 4.1.2.</note> and their bud ſhall riſe vp to duſt, becauſe they caſt off the Law of the Lord of hoaſts,<note place="margin">Auguſt.

                     <p>And as the wicked may be compared vnto the ſtocke, ſo fitly may their ſinnes be compared to the duſt or rottenneſſe;<note place="margin">Propter aridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem.</note> therefore, firſt, as a rotten ſtocke is deſtitute and voide of ſap and humidity whereby it may waxe greene, bud forth and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie; ſo the wicked haue not a liuely ſap, nor the water of the ſpirit of Chriſt Ieſus, whereby they may bud and ſpring vp from dead workes to newneſſe of life; the want thereof the Prophet found in <hi>Ephraim;</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, as rottenneſſe or duſt is not <hi>Solidum quid,</hi> a ſolid matter, but is toſſed with the winde; ſo are the wicked lighter then vanity it ſelfe;<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.4.

                     <p>Secondly, the wicked may be compared vnto that part of the tree which is vnder the ground; for as it doth faſt cleaue vnto the earth, and can hardly be remoued from the ſame, but with great paines and labour; ſo the wicked doe faſt cleaue vnto ſinne, and are ſo ſtedfaſtly glewed vnto the world, and the pleaſures thereof, that not without great difficulty, they cannot be drawn from the ſame: whence it commeth to paſſe, that howſoeuer for a time they may diſſemble, and play the hypocrite with <hi>Demas, Iudas, Saul, Achitophel,</hi> yet at the length they bewray themſelues, and for the loue of the world, they will forſake God himſelfe and his kingdome; that they loue the praiſe of men, more then the praiſe of God, that their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are ſet vpon things below.

                     <p>Firſt, that it is not enough, not to doe euill, vnleſſe alſo we doe good; not enough, not to bring forth bad fruits, vnleſſe alſo we bring forth good fruits.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, that God without partiality or reſpect of perſons, will proceede againſt all ſuch as liue not an holy and ſanctified life, through obedience vnto Gods Commandements.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, it is not enough, not to bring forth bad fruit, vnleſſe alſo we bring forth good fruit: therefore the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Depart from euill, and doe good:</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Ceaſe to doe euill, learne to doe well.</hi> The figge tree was curſed by our Sauiour, not becauſe it brought euill fruit, but becauſe it brought not forth good fruit, whereby his hunger might haue bin ſatisfied. This may teach vs to try and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelues, whether wee haue brought forth good fruits; I doubt not but many will ſay,<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.14.

Thou wilt anſwer me (if truely) that thou haſt not done thoſe things; then I reply, thou art not a good tree, thou doſt not bring forth good fruit, and therefore ſhall be hewne downe: if then thou doſt no good,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.30.</note> thou doſt euill, this doth neceſſarily follow; <hi>He that is not with me is againſt me,</hi> ſaith our Sauiout; if I ſay thou doeſt not that good which thou maiſt, and in ſome meaſure as thou ſhouldeſt, it is fit thou ſhouldſt be hewne down. But alas, what ſhould I ſpeake of bringing forth good fruit, when as men and women in theſe dayes, are ſo fruitfull in euill. And if euen thoſe <hi>trees which bring not forth good fruit, ſhall be hewne downe,</hi> how much more thoſe which altogether bring forth euill? whoſe throat is an open ſepulcher, whoſe heart is a den of theeues, whoſe words and actions tend altogether to the diſhonour of God, as (alas) it is too too common in this wofull age.</p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:15287:23"/>
                     <p>For the ſecond, as trees are known by their fruit, ſo men and women by their obedience vnto Gods Commandements; for to yeeld obedience vnto the whole Law of God, is to bring forth good fruit, ſuch as God requireth. For the illuſtration of this point, theſe two things are to be conſidered. Firſt, by what means we may bring forth good fruit. Secondly, by what ſignes we may diſcerne, if we doe bring forth good fruit.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the firſt, that wee may bring forth good fruit, that is, that we may walke conſcionably, in the practiſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Gods Lawes, both touching our generall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular calling, theſe ſeuen things are required of vs. Firſt, that we take particular notice of theſe which God doth require of vs, of that fruit which God doth expect from vs, an abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof we haue in the ten Commandements. 2. Wee muſt reſolue particularly to yeeld obedience vnto euery one of thoſe Commandements, vnto the whole Law of God, and euery part thereof. 3. We muſt conſider the neceſſity of the performing the ſame, both in reſpect they are commanded by God, and in reſpect that the neglect of them depriueth vs of heauen. 4. We muſt endeauour to be cut off our old ſtocke <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and be engrafted into Ieſus Chriſt. 5. We muſt haue life and iuyce in vs deriued from our root Chriſt Ieſus, whereby we may be made like vnto Chriſt, both in his death by dying vnto ſinne, and in his reſurrection, by riſing to newneſſe of life; whereby we may ſay with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Now I liue,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal 2.20.</note> 
                        <hi>yet not I now but Chriſt liueth in me, and in that I liue now in the fleſh, I line by faith in the ſonne of God, who hath loued me, and giuen himſelfe for me.</hi> As a tree receiueth moiſlure from the root, or otherwiſe cannot fructifie, ſo we cannot bring forth good fruit, vnleſſe we receiue ſpirituall moiſture from Chriſt, <hi>of whoſe fulneſſe we receiue grace for grace.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 1.16.</note> And as trees cannot bring forth fruit, vnleſſe they be well and ſurely rooted; ſo we, vnleſſe by ſaith rooted vnto Ieſus Chriſt 6. Let vs call to minde what great paines God doth take, (as a carefull husband, that we may bring forth fruit) planting, pruning digging, and dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhould all this be in vain, ſhould not we fructifie? 7. Let vs daily pray vnto God, the giuer of all good gifts, that hee
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15287:24"/>would be pleaſed to make vs fructifie.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the ſecond, what ſignes we may diſcerne if we doe bring forth good fruit: I anſwer, that good fruit may be diſcerned,<note place="margin">Col. 2.7.</note> either by the ſight, or by the taſte, but chiefly by both conioyned together, becauſe that ſome fruit (ſuch as the Apples of <hi>Sodom</hi>) doe appeare pleaſant and beautifull to the eye, which yet are vnſauory, bitter and vnpleaſant to the taſte; ſo by viewing and trying our workes, we may diſcerne of their quality and nature, viewing of them, let vs compare them with the good fruit of others, mentioned in Gods word, as our faith with <hi>Abrahams,</hi> our patience with <hi>Iobs,</hi> our wickedneſſe with <hi>Moſes;</hi> and finding that in the qualitie, they agree in the quantity and meaſure they differ, thou maiſt perſwade thy ſelfe, that thy fruit is good, in trying and taſting it if thou finde it ſweet, pleaſant, delectable, whereby thou art deſirous to doe more, and thou wouldeſt not for any thing, but that thou hadſt done it, and doſt reſolue daily, to make a further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, and to bring forth more and better fruit, thou maiſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and be glad, thou art a good tree bringing forth good fruit, to the glory of God and comfort of others.</p>
                     <p>Thus then ye ſee that men and women are to be diſcerned to be good trees, by their obedience vnto the Commandements of God. Which may ſerue for exhortation vnto vs all, euen conſcionably to walke in the wayes of God, careſully to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Law of God, dutifully to become vnto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God both in generall and particular, and then we may be aſſured, that howſoeuer we may in ſome meaſure faile, and in great weakeneſſe and imperfection performe thoſe duties, we are good trees and bring forth good fruit.</p>
                     <p>In vaine doe ſuch boaſt that they are good trees, when as their fruit is bad; a good tree cannot bring forth bad fruit, as a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit; if thou conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueſt in the courſe of vngodlineſſe, if thou be now as much ſet vpon theſe ends, as thou waſt formerly, rather more, if thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideſt in any one particular ſinne, without repentance, if thou doeſt ſpeake againſt the Commandements of God, and will not conforme thy will vnto his, in the obedience of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15287:24"/>ſame, aſſure thy ſelfe, thou art a bad tree, and haſt bad fruit.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the third, God without partiality or reſpect of perſons, will proceede againſt all ſuch, as liue not an holy and ſanctified life in Chriſt Ieſus through obedience vnto his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; he will not proceede againſt the poore and ſpare the rich, againſt inferiors and ſpare ſuperiors; no, no, <hi>euery tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, ſhall be hewne downe:</hi> no man of degree, eſtate or condition, whether high or low, ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour or inferiour, ſhall be exempted from the ſame;<note place="margin">Luk. 13.4.</note>

                     <p>The Reaſons hereof are two. Firſt, in reſpect of the nature of God, impartiall, no accepter of perſons. Secondly,<note place="margin">Act. 10.34.</note> the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, in iudging impenitent ſinners, diſpoſers of grace and ſaluation offred vnto them through Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

Whence it appeareth that it is vaine for vs to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble and be bypocrites in matters of Religion before God, or not to be vpright in our dealings towards men, ſeeing that the Lord both ſeeth all, and vnleſſe we repent iudges all.</p>

                     <p>Touching this Execution of Iudgement,<note place="margin">The <hi>3.</hi> Part.</note> two things are to be conſidered. Firſt, the manner how the Lord will proceede in Iudgement againſt ſuch as bring not forth good fruit. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the time when this Execution ſhall be accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the firſt, the manner how the Lord will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in Iudgement againſt fruitleſſe Chriſtians, is twofold. Firſt, he will <hi>hew them downe.</hi> Secondly, he will <hi>caſt them into the fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the firſt, he will <hi>hew</hi> or <hi>cut them downe.</hi> Men may be ſaid to be cut downe (in generall) from the originall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of Chriſt, by the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> from their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the truth, by apoſtacie, wounding the conſcience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death.

                        <note place="margin">Iob 18.16.</note> there's a cutting (as I take it) by death. Thus both the wicked and the godly may be hewne downe, although in a different manner, for both afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and death vnto Gods children are profitable; euen to the wicked terrible, euen types of their laſt cutting downe at the day of Iudgement. By <hi>hewing</hi> or <hi>cutting downe,</hi> three things may be vnderſtood. Firſt, that diuiſion aad ſeparation which the miniſterie of Gods word would worke amongſt them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the hardneſſe of heart, wherein (iuſtly) they ſhould be giuen vp, if they continued fruitleſſe. Thirdly, that exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſeparation from God, his Angels, Saints, and all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, at the generall, fearefull and terrible day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Hence three things may be gathered:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that the Preaching of Gods word, is the cauſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and diuiſion amongſt men: a thing wonderfull, and yet moſt true; it ſeparateth betwixt the gold and the groſſe, betwixt the Sheepe and the Goates, betwixt the Wheat and the Chaffe; it maketh the father againſt the ſonne, and the ſon againſt the father;<note place="margin">Mat. 10.34.</note> and <hi>thinke not</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>that I come to ſend peace on earth, I come not to ſend peace, but a ſword. Paul</hi> was a perſecuter, he was in great credit and eſtimation, but when he became a Preacher, he was perſecuted from place to place: the word bringeth to light, and diſcouereth ſome to be hypocrites, which both had deceiued themſelues and others; what diuiſion and ſeparation did this make in the primitiue Church, in this Land in the dayes of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> in <hi>France</hi> at this day, take one example for all; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hauing preached vnto the <hi>Iewes</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſome were perſwaded with the things which were ſpoken, ſome beleeued not.<note place="margin">Acts 24.24.</note> I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance diuers other examples, touching this operation of the Word in making diuiſion, betwixt neighbours, brothers, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:15287:26"/>and children, husband and wife, yea betwixt a man and himſelfe. So that the Word preached, as it doth confirme Gods children, it he weth downe hypocrites, and diſcouereth what they are.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſes hereof are not in the Preaching of the Word; for the Sunne is all one, that ſhineth vpon pleaſant Gardens, and vpon ſtinking Dunghils; the fire all one, which hardneth the Clay, and ſoftneth the Waxe; the Word all one, that is preached to the godly and vngodly; but in reſpect of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which is betwixt the hearers. The godly heare it, and bring forth good fruit, the wicked heare it, and remaine fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſo it <hi>heweth them downe.</hi> The wicked not perceiuing the benefit which may bereaped by the word, but hating it, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ſinfull deſires, and ſo coutemning it, remaine igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the vſe of it, and ſo are iuſtly cut downe. Whence I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, firſt, that notwithſtanding of this hewing downe, of this ſeparation, and diuiſion which the Goſpell worketh, yet it is moſt needfull to be preached; for it is better that hypocrites be diſcouered and hewne downe, then remaine in cloſe, they ſhould both depriue themſelues and others, yea and there be a ſeparation betwixt ſuch, as are by the moſt ſtrict bonds of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture coupled together, that ſome of them might be ſaued, then that continuing in worldly friendſhip all ſhould periſh. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that not the Goſpell or Miniſtery of Gods word is the cauſe of our <hi>hewing do we,</hi> but our contempt thereof diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, which I ſpeake for this end, becauſe many blame the Goſpell for all theſe hurts which befall them, as Maſter <hi>Latimer</hi> noteth in one of his Sermons, Vpon a time (ſaith he) the people of <hi>Sandwicke</hi> met together to conſult about the ſeaſon, why their towne was more ouer blowne with Sand in few yeares, then it was of a long time before; an old man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he did remember that there was no ſteeple nye, but ſince there were the ſame might come vpon that occaſion, whereby he ment that preaching of Gods word might be the cauſe, as aſſuredly many wrongfully imagine touching other things.</p>
                     <p>The Vſes of this point are three fold.</p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:15287:26"/>
                     <p>For conſolation vnto the children of God, howſoeuer that by the preaching of the word hypocrites <hi>ſhall be hewne downe,</hi> yet they ſhall be ſafe. The Goſpell is the power of God vnto ſaluation to all them that beleeue; it is to them the ſauour of life vnto life. If we belong vnto God, the word of God ſhall be profitable vnto vs; if we receiue it with meekneſſe, it is able to ſaue our ſoules.</p>
                     <p>Gods children by the word bring forth good fruit, ſome thirty, ſixty, and a hundred fold; Gods word doth worke in them ſorrow for finne, humiliation, an auoiding of the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſinne, a labour to performe the workes of pietie and godlineſſe, and may we not much reioyce when we performe thoſe things.</p>
                     <p>For Inſtruction: the cleare ſhining of the Goſpell doth gall and torment wicked men; which is a ſigne they did neuer feele the power of Gods ſpirit within them, working for their conuerſion. Of thoſe men there are two ſorts, the one more publike, the other more priuate. Some publikely fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God with a ſtretched out Arme, and a ſtiffe necke, as <hi>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>that I ſhould know him?</hi> Others goe more ſubtilly to worke, are more politicke then the former; They are fauourites of the Goſpell, whilſt there is proſperity and peace. The <hi>Galathians</hi> eſteemed of <hi>Paul</hi> as an Angell of light; the towne of <hi>Millan</hi> was ſo affected to <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that rather they would looſe their liues, then their Biſhop: <hi>Dauid</hi> had friends; yet the caſe is altered; the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians</hi> fall away, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> not ſo much reſpected; <hi>Dauid,</hi> by ſuch as bare him fare formerly, perſecuted. <hi>Moſes</hi> was not at all times eſteemed alike; when Chriſt turned the water into Wine, and fed the people by hundreds and thouſands, all was well, then he was called <hi>Rabbi</hi> and <hi>Rabboni,</hi> then they would make him a King, &amp;c. but when hee ſaid, they <hi>are of their father the Diuell,</hi> then away with him, <hi>crucifie him: Paul</hi> now called <hi>Mercurius,</hi> by and by a murtherer; theſe our dayes are full of ſuch, whilſt there is peace, then they feeme religious, when trouble commeth, they not onely reuolt, but perſecute ſuch as are truely religious.</p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:15287:27"/>
                     <p>It is true that the children of God, being aſleepe, left vnto themſelues for a time, may be offended at the word preached (who therfore are by the preachers of Gods word to be rouſed from their ſecuritie, that they may perceiue their errour, rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed I ſay by the terrour threatned out of the Law of God; if they haue a long time continued in the courſe of godlineſſe, or otherwiſe if they be but nouices in the ſchoole of Chriſt, by a more milder courſe) but they doe not ſo continue, they repent, they are ſorry, they are grieued for the ſame, where as the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed remaine ſtill ſo yea daily grow worſe and worſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ſhall be hewne downe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, that ſuch as remaine fruitleſſe, and will not be reformed, ſhall be giuen ouer vnto the hardneſſe of their owne heart, and left vnto their owne deſerued condemnation: This is a terrible puniſhment, a fearefull <hi>hewing downe,</hi> which proceedeth from the contempt of Gods word, when the wicked haue had the outward Miniſterie of Gods word for a long time, and God hath by it called them to repentance, offering grace and ſaluation vnto them, if they doe not embrace it, but continue in their back wardneſſe and rebellion, then the Lord by hardneſſe of heart, hewing them downe, he maketh their hearts fat, <hi>ſo that hearing they doe not heare, ſeeing they dee not ſee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O let vs be carefull to preuent this fearefull iudgement, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let vs be hewne downe, by croſſes, affliction, and death, then by hardneſſe of heart; let vs pray vnto the Lord daily to mollifie and ſoften our heart.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that the wicked at the day of iudgement, ſhall by a perpetuall ſeparation, <hi>be hewne downe</hi> from the fellowſhip of the holy Trinitie, bleſſed Angels, and glorified Saints, which our Sauiour himſelfe confirmeth,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Goe yee curſed of my father vnto euerlaſting fire, prepared for the Diuell and his Angels;</hi> their hewing downe by the word in this world, precedes their hewing downe at the day of iudgement; that proceedeth from this; for ſuch as are here hewed downe, by the miniſtery of the word, giuen ouer to a reprobate minde, and an hard heart, ſhall then by finall ſeparation be hewed downe, from the preſence of God.</p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:15287:27"/>
                     <p>This letteth vs ſee the miſcrable eſtate of wicked men, both in this life and in the life to come: here they are hewed downe by the miniſtrie of Gods word, then they ſhall be perpetually hewed downe by the ſentence of the iuſt Iudge, <hi>Goe ye curſed of my father, &amp;c.</hi> This finall hewing downe ſhall not befall vnto all ſinners, but onely to ſuch as are impenitent; many may in this world be hewed downe, by temporall iudgements, which repenting ſhall not be hewed downe in this laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mknt. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the <hi>Iewes, And they alſo, if they abide not ſtill in vnbeliefe, ſhall be grafted in,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 11.23.</note> 
                        <hi>for God is able to graffe them in againe.</hi> Such as belong vnto God may for a time fall away (as all ſuch doe totally, which are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly planted and not inwardly) and ſo by aſſliction hewed downe, but they doe riſe againe, and by repentance blot out their fall, and therefore ſhall eſcape this finall hewing downe.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond, <hi>he will caſt them into the fire:</hi> by <hi>fire</hi> in this place we may vnderſtand, the iudgement which at the great day ſhall be executed vpon wicked men, the extreame and moſt ſharpe paine appointed for them in hell; concerning which, theſe ſixe things are to be conſidered. Firſt, that it is fearefull. Secondly, that it is painefull. Thirdly, that it is vnſpeakeably painfull. Fourthly, that it is continuall. Fiftly, that is vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall. Sixtly, that it is eternall: other queſtions as being more curious then profitable, I willingly paſſe by; ſuch, as whether it be a materiall fire, how it is maintained, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I ſay it is fearefull, and that if either wee conſider the place where it is, <hi>Hell;</hi> for what it is to torment wicked men, how vnpleaſant it is, not for light, heat, or comfort, as other fire is, but to torment and terrifie, accompanied with diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther torments, vtter darkneſſe, the worme that neuer dieth, weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, which ſhall neuer be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; fearefull was that deſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> but more fearefull this, that did end, this ſhall neuer.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is painfull, and therefore called <hi>the Lake bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with fire and brimſtone:</hi> the extremitie whereof both in body and ſoule, the heart of man is not able to conceiue; a taſte
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15287:28"/>where of we may haue in the rich Glutton.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is vnſpeakeable: as <hi>Paul</hi> was not able to expreſſe the ioyes of heauen, no more can wee the extremitie of this fire.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.12.</note> it is continuall, alwayes without any intermiſſion, which doth ſo much the more agrauate the miſery of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, this fire cannot be put out.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, it is vniuerſall, both vpon ſoule and body, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, both outwardly and inwardly.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.41.</note> it is eternall: if it would once ceaſe, though after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand yeares, there were ſome hope, but it ſhall continue world without end, for euermore, from whence there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                     <p>Hence we may learne, that ſeeing this fire is ſo fearefull, ſo painfull, ſo vnſpeakable, ſo continuall, ſo vniuerſall, ſo perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and the wicked not repenting them of their ſinnes, ſhall be (without doubt) caſt thereinto, euen in time to forſake our ſinnes, and to turne vnto the Lord, by true and vnfained repentance, bring forth good fruit, where by we may eſcape ſo terrible a torment, the fire of hell. O let vs feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when we heare or read hereof, yea let vs alwayes haue it before our eyes, that wee may be withdrawne from ſinne, leaſt ſinning and not repenting, wee become partakers thereof.</p>
                     <p>O wicked man why doeſt thou runne on in ſinne, why art thou ſo careleſſe of thine owne welfare? wouldeſt thou burne willingly? thinkeſt thou, that thou canſt abide the fire? no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thou canſt not: if thou canſt not abide that the leaſt member of thy body ſhould abide in the fire, but for a little time, how ſhalt thou be able to abide the fire of hell, both in body and ſoule eternally?</p>
                     <p>Concerning the ſecond: when this Execution ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed: although that chiefly it ſhall be executed in the great and generall day of iudgement, yet notwithſtanding it doth begin euen in this life; as then <hi>they ſhall be</hi> finally <hi>hewne downe and caſt into the fire</hi> of bell; ſo alſo here they ſhall be hewne downe by the miniſtry of Gods word, and feele this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:15287:28"/>fire begunne in them, their Conſcience accuſing them, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments affrighting them, they themſelues driuen vnto deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Hence wee may perceiue the miſerable eſtate of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, both here and hereafter, in this life and in that which is to come.</p>
                     <p>Whereby we may learne in time to become obedient vnto the Preaching of Gods Word, not deſpiſing the gracious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of mercie; for certainly, to conclude with the words of my Text, <hi>Euery tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, ſhall be hewne downe and caſt rute the fire.</hi>

                     <hi>both he and all that did belong to him were bleſſed of God, for the Arke was not
<pb facs="tcp:15287:31"/>onely a token of Gods preſence, but alſo a type of our miniſtery;</hi> To which God hath conioyned himſelfe to be preſent with vs vnto the end of the world. By the Arke many miracles were done, by it the waters of Jordan were diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the walls of Jericho fell downe to the ground, the Jdoll Dagon was diſmembred. But the Arke of the new Couenant doth much more, it paſſeth all Gods children through the mighty floods of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, breaketh downe the walls of temptation, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth Popiſh Jdolatry to <hi>Gebena</hi> from whence it came, as not able to looke the truth in the face, this doth preſent Chriſt the way, the truth, and the life, and doth exhibite Chriſt vnto vs, God and man to be our righteouſnes, ſanctification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Now the way to meet with all theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, with <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> is to entertaine the Arke of the Gospell, but yet theſe bleſsings are not obtained in respect of the preſence of the Gospell, but in reſpect of beleeuing, obeying, and reuerent eſtimation and entertainement of the ſame, for as we muſt loue God, imbrace his lawes, aduance the Gospell, ſo muſt we imitate the example of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed-Edom,</hi> who did not breake the tables of

The Reaſon may be framed thus: If thoſe iudgements which are denounced againſt you, cannot otherwiſe be remou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by true and vnfained Repentance, then it is needfull that you ſhould repent: but thoſe iudgements which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt you, cannot otherwiſe be remoued, therefore it is needfull that you ſhould repent.</p>
                  <p>Hence this obſeruation may be gathered: that,</p>
                  <p>When either Gods hand is heauie vpon vs, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> or his iudgements are denounced againſt vs, we ought vnfainedly to repent vs of our ſinnes. Gods hand was heauie vpon the <hi>Iewes</hi> at this time, as may be gathered out of the former chapter, greater iudgements were denounced againſt them, in the beginning of this, and therefore now they are exhorted vnto Repentance. Thus did <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chro. 20.</note> hearing that the <hi>Aramites</hi> were come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, <hi>He ſet himſelfe to ſeeke the Lord, and proclaimed a

                     <note place="margin">Iudg. 20.26.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſat there before the Lord, and faſted that day vntill the euening.</hi> Thus did the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuites</hi> after the denunciation of Gods iudgements by <hi>Ionah.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ionah 3.5.</note> Hence it is that the Prophets, after they had denounced. Gods iudgements, did alwayes from thence exhort them vnto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Thus <hi>Iſaiah, Why ſhould yee be ſtricken any more,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 1.5.16.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c. waſh you, and make you cleane.</hi> Thus <hi>Ieremiah,</hi>

                     <hi>I will bring euill from the North, and a great deſtruction; for this, gird you with ſackcloath, lament and houle.</hi> Thus <hi>Daniel</hi> hauing expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> dreame, and warned him of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching fall, exhorteth him to <hi>breake off his ſinnes by righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi>

                     </note> Becauſe Gods hand is heauie vpon vs, and his Iudgements are denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt vs; for this end, that we may repent and returne vnto him: according to that of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Iſa. 26.16.</note>

                  <p>Secondly, becauſe vpon Repentance, God doth withdraw his Iudgements either inflicted or denounced: inflicted, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from the <hi>Iſraelites, He regarded their affliction, when he heard their crie:</hi> threatned, from the <hi>Niniuites; And God ſaw their workes,</hi>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15287:35"/>that he had ſaid he would doe vnto them, and he did it not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Vſes of this point are twofold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Reprehenſion vnto all of vs in this Land, vpon which Gods hand lyeth heauie, againſt which ſo many Iudgements are denounced, and yet (alas) we continue in our euill courſes, and doe not repent vs of our ſinnes; yet which is worſe, we daily grow worſe and worſe, adding ſinne vnto finue, and multiplying our abominations in Gods ſight. What could haue beene done more vnto vs, then the Lord hath done? yea at this ſame time, all thoſe cauſes whereby God hath prouoked others to humiliation, concurre together to moue vs to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Publike, open, powerfull and malicious enemies hunt after our deſtruction, that they may deface Gods glory, root out Religion, poſſeſſe our Inheritance, and make our ſtreets runne ouer with blood. God bloweth vpon thoſe actions which we vndertake, either by Sea or Land, as daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth: Gods Iudgements both in generall and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular are denounced againſt vs, as they were againſt the <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites;</hi> we haue beene viſited with the Plague, the famin, ſtrange diſeaſes, &amp;c.

                  <p>For Exhortation both vnto Preachers and People.</p>
                  <p>Preachers to be carefull both in fore-ſeeing and fore-warning Gods Iudgements; <label type="milestone">

God hath appointed vs Watchmen, Seers, Ambaſſadours, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, we muſt accordingly declare Gods will vnto you, and both ſhew you your diſeaſe, your danger, and the meanes whereby you may be deliuered.

                  <p>People, euen truely to repent them of their ſinnes, in reſpect of Gods Iudgements both lying vpon vs, and greater hanging ouer our heads. Hath God beene pleaſed to ſpare you ſo long, and not quite deſtroyed you, repent in time, become obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vnto the word of God calling vpon you. Repent I ſay, that God may be glorified in his mercy, our enemies may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, our preſent calamities remoued, and further iudgements preuented: to conclude this point, ſeeing God hath dealt with vs in this Land, as he did with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> ſeeing he exhorteth vs vnto Repentance by a Proclamation of Iudgements as he did them, and we haue as much neede to repent as they had, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with that exhortation of <hi>Zephaniah, Gather your ſelues together,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zeph. 2.1.</note> 
                     <hi>yea gather together a Nation not deſired before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree bring forth, before the day paſſe as the chaffe, before the fierce anger of the Lord come vpon you:</hi> otherwiſe the Lord may iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the day of his wrath make vs ſubiect vnto the crueltie and ſlauery of our enemies. Thus of the 1. Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon whereby our Prophet exhorteth the <hi>Iewes</hi> vnto Repentance,<note place="margin">The time, <hi>Now alſo.</hi>
                     </note> is taken from the time wherein he did exhort them, laid downe in theſe words, <hi>Now alſo,</hi> wherein di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things may be noted. 1. That as at this time, ſo alſo at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times the Lord hath exhorted them vnto Repentance, as might be confirmed by the Propheſies of <hi>Ionah, Amos, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, Iſaias, Micah, Nahum,</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> all which did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede this our Prophet <hi>Ioel.</hi> Secondly, that as yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained hope for them of obtaining pardon, and preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe Iudgements threatned, if they would truely returne vnto the Lord. Thirdly, that God did not promiſe againe to call vpon them, or any longer to ſpare them, if they did
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:15287:36"/>not delay, and put off their Repentance, as formerly. The Reaſon may be framed thus; If God haue ſpared you ſo long, and not vtterly deſtroyed you notwithſtanding of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, and doth now alſo inuite you to Repentance; not like to ſpare you any longer, if you doe not now amend, then you ought to returne vnto him: but ſo it is, that God hath yet ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red now, doth now alſo inuite you to Repentance, and is not like any longer to beare with you; therefore you ought now to Repent, now to turne vnto the Lord. Hence this obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth ariſe: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                     </label> that,</p>
                  <p>The bounteouſneſſe, patience, and long ſuffering of God ought to moue vs vnto a preſent and ſpeedy Repentance. God hath beene bountifull vnto the <hi>Iewes,</hi> in exhorting them ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, in ſending ſo many Prophets vnto them; hee had long born with their frowardneſſe and backwardneſſe, he had wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelfe by waiting vpon them; yet againe he offereth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them mercy, by the ſame, to prouoke them vnto a ſpeedy and preſent Repentance.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.4.</note> This the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> confirmeth; <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſſe, and forbearance, and long ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſſe of God leadeth thee vnto Repentance.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.2.</note> And againe, <hi>Behold, now is the acceptable time,</hi>

                     <hi>behold now is the day of ſaluation.</hi> And againe, <hi>Exhort one another daily, while it is called to daie, leſt anie of you be hardned through the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne: to day if ye will heare his voice harden not your hearts.</hi>

                  <p>The Reaſons hereof are theſe.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" n="2" unit="Reason"/>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe if we doe not Repent, and returne vnto the Lord, then we ſhall be left inexcuſable, we ſhall be forced to confeſſe Gods iuſt iudgement in our confuſion, following vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the contempt of his mercy offered vnto vs; yea after our hardneſſe and impenitent hearts,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.5.</note>

                  <p>For Exhortation vnto euery one of vs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To be thankfull vnto God, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The Vſes of this Doctrine are theſe two.</p>

                  <p>The Vſes hereof are theſe two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to teach vs. that we ſhould haue the word of God in great eſtimation: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> We feare to be drowned by water, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by land, and euery member of our bodies to become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto many ſorrowes; and yet thoſe eſpecially hurt when we ſee and feele them, but the word of God worketh when
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:15287:41"/>when we neither ſee nor feele it. The croſſe afflicteth vs, but the word inſtructeth vs; afflictions puniſh, and bring vs the heauy newes of condemnation, but the word bringeth glad tydings of life euerlaſting; by iudgements we are blinded, by the Goſpell we are enlightned; by Iudgements we are indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, by the Goſpell we are defended; Iudgements threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the life, Gods word doth threaten our ſoule with euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting death, vnleſſe we repent: make much of the word in thy health, for I aſſure thee,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.18.</note> ſickneſſe cannot ſo prepare thee for the Lord, the word will then be ſweet to heare, when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers faile; miracles would make vs wonder, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures make vs proud, but Gods word maketh vs to Repent, and to liue the life of God in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</p>
                  <p>It may be obiected: this ſeemeth a ſtrange doctrine; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                     </label> Doe not ſorrowes and afflictions conuert vs vnto the Lord? Why then are they ſent? why ſhould we account of them as we doe, ſeeing ſuch as are afflicted reape ſo ſmall comfort by them? I anſwer, that this concluſion is damnable: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> Shall not the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler care for the rod, becauſe it cannot teach him; and ſhould we ſet light by the Lords Iudgements, becauſe they cannot conuert vs? No, they muſt keepe vs in obedience, although they cannot beget obedience within vs; they informe vs, though they cannot turne vs: as <hi>Dauid</hi> was afraid of iudgement, ſo muſt we; let vs tremble as the earth doth, let vs weepe and mourne, we know not how ſoene the wrath of God may ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>aze vpon vs, with what calamity we may be troubled, by what death we may be taken away. Let vs, I ſay, feare the word and workes of God, and then we ſhall not neede to feele them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to teach vs, that when we are viſited by Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> euen to pray vnto the Lord, that he would by them worke our conuerſion, ſeeing that of themſelues they cannot beget Repentance within vs. Thus in generall.</p>
                  <p>I come now to ſpeake of the Duetie in particular, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall in the affections, in theſe words; <hi>Turne yee euen to mee with all your heart:</hi> and externall in the action; <hi>with faſting,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:15287:42"/>and with weeping, and with mourning.</hi> Of theſe two in order.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the firſt. The inwsrd forme of Repentance is deſcribed in theſe words, <hi>Turne yee euen to mee with all your heart:</hi> wherein theſe points are to be handled. 1. The action, <hi>Turne.</hi> 2. The perſons exhorted to turne, <hi>yee,</hi> euery one of them. 3. To whom they muſt turne, <hi>to mee,</hi> the Lord. 4. How they muſt turne, <hi>euen with all their heart,</hi> ſpeedily, readily, and willingly.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Point.</hi> Turne.</note> The Duetie whereunto our Prophet exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them, is to <hi>turne,</hi> or to come vnto themſelues againe: whereby two things are intimated. Firſt, that ſuch as ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, in ſo doing depart from him. Secondly, that ſuch as doe truely repent them of their ſinnes, they doe turne from their wickedneſſe and euill wayes; So that true Repentance is a turning from ſinne and wickedneſſe; yea onely ſuch as truely repent are in their right mindes, all others are out of their wits, mad and franticke.</p>
                  <p>For the vnderſtanding of this Point, theſe foure things are to be conſidered. Firſt, the nature of it. Secondly, the reaſons to moue vs vnto it. Thirdly, the meanes whereby to attaine it. Fourthly, the ſignes whereby it may be diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>The nature of it may be the better conceiued,<note place="margin">The nature of our turning.</note> by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it to the conuerſion of earthly bodies in the Scriptures: as the Sunne is turned into darkneſſe, ſo men ſhining in this world muſt be aſhamed and confounded becauſe of their ſinnes: as the Moone ſometimes encreaſeth, at other times decreaſeth, alwayes changing; ſo muſt a ſinner be alwayes decreaſing in ſinne, increaſing in grace; as a rocke is turned into water, ſo muſt our hard hearts into plenty of teares; as a ſtone is turned into copper, and giueth a ſound, ſo when we are touched by the ſpirit of God, then muſt the voyce of our confeſſion ſound: as the Sea is dried vp, ſo muſt our bitterneſſe of ſinne be turned into the drouth of repentance: as the ſparkles of fire aſcend, when the body being mixed with earth cannot, ſo although our bodies as yet cannot aſcend, yet we ſend our ſparkles and teares vnto the Lord: as fire doth mollifie the hardeſt Iron, ſo muſt our hard hearts by Gods ſpirit. This fire is kept vnder the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15287:42"/>aſhes of humility, and the remembrance of the day of death, whoſe feare doth conſerue the fire of Gods grace in the heart of a penitent ſinner. Briefly, this conuerſion is a turning from ſinne, yea from euery ſinne;<note place="margin">Heb 12.1.</note>

                     <hi>and from the wickedneſſe that is in their hands.</hi> It is a ready and ſpeedy turning, for by delay we endanger our owne ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons which may moue vs to turne are theſe. 1.<note place="margin">The Reaſons why we ſhould turne.</note> The Neceſſity. 2 The Equity. 3. The Vtility.</p>
                  <p>The Neceſſity, if either we conſider God, our ſelues, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> our euill wayes, or the reward due vnto them. God, who is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with vs whilſt we goe from him; which doth earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhort vs, and abſolutely command vs to returne vnto him: our ſelues, poore, ſilly, wretched creatures, which may eaſily be deceiued &amp; led headlong vnto deſtruction: our euill waies, euill in themſelues, abhominable in Gods ſight, hatefull vnto good men, leading vnto euerlaſting condemnation: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward due vnto them, death and euerlaſting torments in the fire of hell.</p>
                  <p>The Equity: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> whether it is more equall that we ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God, or the diuell; the motions of Gods ſpirit, or our owne corrupted natures: hath God beene ſo kinde and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vnto vs, it is moſt iuſt and equall, that we alſo ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obedient vnto him.</p>
                  <p>The Vtility: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as thoſe which runne on in wickedneſſe are in the way of deſtruction, and in danger of deſtruction; ſo alſo ſuch as doe returne, and forſake their former wayes, ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>The meanes whereby we may attaine vnto this conuerſion, and it may be effected in vs, are theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The meanes whereby we may be moued to turne.</note> we muſt haue the knowledge of the Law of God in our vnderſtanding. Secondly, we muſt know what our ſinnes and tranſgreſſions are, which we doe commit againſt the Law. Thirdly, we muſt know the guilt of ſinne, cleauing vnto the action it ſelfe. Fourthly, we muſt know the iudgements and wrath of God, which doe ſeaſe vpon ſuch as breake this Law.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15287:43"/>Thoſe points being throughly marked; in the next place the ſinner is to apply the ſame vnto the conſcience after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which may be called the practicall Syllogiſme of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Euery one which breaketh the Law of God, is guiltie of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death, ſaith the minde.</l>

                  <p>The meditation hereof turneth the minde from ſinne to godlineſſe.</p>

                  <p>For the 1.<note place="margin">The meanes whereby the heart is turned</note> The meanes whereby our hearts may be turned are theſe. 1. The conſideration of our miſerable eſtate by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 2. The meditation of our preſent eſtate by grace. 3. An acknowledgement and confeſſion of our great corruptions. 4.

By paying our vowes vnto the Lord, fearing our ſelfe in our beſt actions, and Satans readines to ſet vpon vs, approouing our ſelfe by ſtriuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt corruption, liuing in ſpirituall duties, louing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, waiting for our end. 4.

                  <p>Now I come to ſpeake of the outward forme of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which concerneth action, conſiſting of three parts. 1. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. 2. Weeping. 3. Mourning. The former was to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall in the affection, this externall, and in action, whence this generall obſeruation doth ariſe: that.</p>
                  <p>Both outward and inward repentance muſt bee ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Peter</hi> to expreſſe his repentance wept bitterly: where the body is wounded, there iſſueth out blood,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.75.</note> ſo where there is true repentance in the heart, it doth outwardly expreſſe it ſelfe, in faſting, weeping, and mourning.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons here of are theſe two. 1. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> becauſe (although out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward repentance may be where there wanteth the inward, yet) the inward cannot be without the outward, yea, where the outward is, we ought charitably to iudge of the inward 2. <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The vſes hereof are twofold.</p>
                  <p>For inſtruction: Repentance muſt be in the heart; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> and not in the heart only, but alſo in the workes; and not in the works onely, but alſo in the affection, &amp; not in the affection onely, but alſo in the conuerſation, a ſmall reformation, is not a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. If good lawes bee not ioyned with godly minds, and reformed wayes with weeping hearts; neither the one, nor the other, ſhall giue vs comfort. Therefore we muſt conioyne both together.</p>
                  <p>For exhortation. As we are not afraid or aſhamed to ſinne, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> ſo let vs not be aſhamed to ſhew forth the tokens of our humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. Many like theeues are not aſhamed to ſteale, but are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:15287:47"/>to confeſſe. Let vs rather glory in repenting for our ſinnes, then in acting of them: wee haue many ſinnes, let vs ſhed many teares, wee haue great ſinnes, let vs ſhed foorth great ſorrow for ſinne: We haue watched in ſinne, let us watch in prayer, we haue loued ſinne, now let vs loue to ſorrow for ſinne, looke on thy ſoule weeping, as thou waſt wont to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy ſins reioycing. Haſt thou beene a drunkard, be ſober; if a theefe, feare God: if a blaſphemer, vſe Gods name reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and as <hi>Paul</hi> of theſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.28.</note> ſo I ſay of all ſinne, <hi>Let him that hath ſinned, ſinne no more.</hi> Thus let vs by our outward humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and repentance giue a teſtimony, both vnto our ſelfe and others, of our inward, that as outwardly, ſo alſo we are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled inwardly.

The Reaſon is, becauſe the intention of a mans minde cannot perfectly be ſet vpon two contrary obiects at one time, therefore it is moſt fit to deferre the one till the other be accompliſhed, and what we ſaue by faſting to beſtow vpon the poore, as they did in the primitiue Church,<note place="margin">Aug. ſuper Pſa.</note> whereunto S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> doth exhort in theſe words; <hi>Let that which is withdrawne from our daintie fare, be giuen to the needy: let hungry Chriſt receiue that which a fasting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

                  <p>For the 4.

Internall, conſiſting of two parts, Repentance and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Repentance conſiſting of two parts, ſorrowing for ſinnes paſt, leading of a new life. In the ſorrowing for ſinnes paſt, there muſt be firſt a ſenſe and feeling of our miſery: ſecondly, lamentation for it. Thirdly, an vnfolding of the ſame before God. 1. I ſay, there muſt be a ſenſe and feeling of ſinne: to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force which we are to remember, the time, place, and manner of our ſinnes; we are to take notice that our ſinnes offend God; and that we deſerue puniſhment both in this life and the life to come: for which we muſt mourne and faſt, which is true humiliation. 2. We muſt lament our miſery, which is the groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the heart, and is ſometime expreſſed by our voyce and teares; and if God heare the groanes of other creatures, how much more the groanes of his owne children, 3. We muſt confeſſe this our miſerable eſtate to God, not in generall, but in particular, that hereby we may acknowledge Gods goodneſſe, and our owne wickedneſſe; which, vntill we haue ſome grace, we are ſtill aſhamed to confeſſe, although to ſuch as doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their ſinnes, God is faithfull and iuſt to forgiue them. Prayer, 1. That the Lord would remoue his iudgements from vs. 2. That he would beſtow all ſorts of bleſſings vpon vs. 3. That God would giue vs grace; firſt, to abſtaine from euill, of which Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> ſaid, It is a pleaſant fact to the body, when the minde faſteth from vice; for if we would haue God to turne from the euill of puniſhment, we muſt firſt turne from the euill of ſinne: for what profit is it to aſtaine from the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of fleſh, if in the meane time both the mouth and our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther members be giuen ouer vnto impieties, to abſtaine from meat and to doe euill, is the Diuels faſt, who doth euill, and yet eateth nothing. 2. To doe that which is good: firſt, in performing our dutie towards God: ſecondly, in louing one another, forgiuing wrongs done vnto vs, and debts owen by the poore, if they be not able to pay: which three are by our
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:15287:50"/>Sauiour ioyned together, Faſting, Prayer, and Almeſdeeds;<note place="margin">Mat 6.</note> which actions of Chriſtianity ought to be performed by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian; we muſt be like <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Foure dayes agoe, I was faſting, vntill this houre, and at the ninth houre,</hi>

                     <hi>I prayed in my houſe, and behold a man ſtood before me in bright cleathing, and ſaid, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine almes are had in remembrance in the ſight of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the 6. This dutie is thus to be performed. Firſt,<note place="margin">How wee ought to faſt.</note> there muſt be an abſtinence from meat and drinke, that the body may be afflicted: yet ſo, that nature be not deſtroyed, neither we made more vnfit for ſpirituall duties. 2. We muſt abſtaine from morning vntill night, as by the Scriptures, the cuſtome of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and the cuſtome of the Church thereafter is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and plaine. 3. We muſt abſtaine from all pleaſures which may prouoke vs to ſin. 4. All perſons (excepting ſuch as want ſtrength and diſcretion) are bound to keepe this humiliation. 5. We ought to put on our meaneſt apparell. 6. We muſt make a more ſolemne confeſſion of our ſinnes, both in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and in particular with more ſtrong cries and groanes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pardon for our ſinnes, with plenty of teares, which were accompanied with putting on ſack-cloath, bowing of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, renting of the garments, lying in the duſt, of which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Micah</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Therefore will I wait and houle,</hi>

                  <p>For the 7. The ends of Faſting are 1. To ſubdue the fleſh,<note place="margin">The ends of Faſting.</note> and mortifie our bodily luſts, that they may become ſubiect to the will of God. 2. To ſtirre vp deuotion and attention vnto holy duties; for by it the heart and affections become lighter, purer, more fit, and in better order for the ſeruice of God. 3. To teſtifie by our humiliation that we deſerue to be cut off from God; that we deny our ſelues the vſe of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and that we rather deſerue death, as being by reaſon of ſin, vnworthy to enioy the ſmalleſt of Gods creatures.</p>
                  <p>For the 8.<note place="margin">The benefit. of caſting.</note> The benefits of Faſting (beſides thoſe formerly mentioned) are diuers. 1. Hereby both bleſſings haue beene
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:15287:51"/>obtained, and fearefull iudgements haue beene remoued, yea turned into bleſſings. 2. By it Gods children haue not onely beene confirmed, but aſſuredly perſwaded of their ſaluation. 3. By it Sathan is defeated, caſt out and ouerthrowne, and the Saints are more enabled to the performance of all Chriſtian duties; and the like fauour may the Church of God expect in the conſcionable performance hereof, vnto the worlds end. 4. By this we teſtifie our dutie to God, before we dare meddle with the creatures for our comfort. 5. Hereby we learne mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, whereas the fulneſſe of bread begetteth vncleanneſſe; thus did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> bring his body into ſubiection to the Law of God;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.</note> ſo alſo <hi>Hilarion</hi> a deuout man, hauing after much faſting (for he eat but a little bread, and drunke water) felt the power of the fleſh within him, knocked vpon his breaſt with his hand: <hi>Thou heaſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Ile make thee leaue kicking, neither will I feede thee with barlie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieron de Vita Hilar.</note> 
                     <hi>but with chaffe, I will pull thee downe with hunger and thirſt, and lade thee with heauie weights, and hunt thee through heat and cold, that thou maieſt rather thinke on meat then of wantonneſſe.</hi> And the Reaſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, becauſe plenty maketh the ſtings of luſt to branch out; as vermine, weeds, and vnbroken clods, hinder a plentifull har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt. 6. Hereby the minde is eleuated towards heauen, both by conforming our bodies to our mindes (according to that of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Iſa. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>In their affliction they will ſeeke me early:</hi>) as alſo by cutting vs away, from our worldly delights, from which we ought to abſtaine (though they are lawfull) to giue our ſelues to Faſting and Prayer.<note place="margin">Ne quidem tempora idonea, qui ſuper ſunt. Bafilde Ir. hom. <hi>1.</hi> pag. <hi>327.</hi>

It doth further our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, both in following after, and going before the ſame: In following after, as in the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> and <hi>Dauid.</hi> The <hi>Niniuites</hi> ſinned, and would not eat, ſinned and would not be cloathed, ſinned and would not giue their beaſts food; we ſin, and yet we
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:15287:51"/>eat, yea we ſin in eating: we ſin, and yet we drinke, yea we ſin in drinking; we ſin and cloath our ſelues, and ſin by cloathing. In going before, becauſe it is a chaſtiſement which a ſinner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth vpon himſelfe for his offence; therefore ſaith S. <hi>Baſil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Simil.</note> As wormes which breed in childrens bellies muſt be expelled by bitter medicines, ſo ſin by faſting: and S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, that delicate fare is pleaſant (though hurtfull) to the body; as hony maketh the liuer to ſwell, which better things bring in temper: ſo faſting, although it ſeeme vnpleaſant, yet is moſt profitable.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And with mourning.</hi> This is the third thing required. The word in the originall ſignifieth, not onely a weeping, whereby teares appeare but alſo mourning, which is in affliction, in the inward parts, which chiefly belongeth vnto a funerall pompe, as 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.13. So that the Prophet doth not require them onely to faſt, but likewiſe to weepe, to mourne, to groane in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:15287:52"/>the ſpirit with ſighs and ſobs vnto the Lord, to be wounded in ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>For the better vnderſtanding of this godly ſorrow and mourning, we are to vnderſtand that weeping and mourning is a moſt excellent medicine for a troubled conſcience, yea for the moſt part, they doe accompany the ſame, therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">

                     </note> 
                     <hi>That teares were his bread night and day,</hi> whereupon <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiodor</hi> ſaith, that mourning is the food of the ſoule, the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of the ſenſes, the abſolution of ſinne, the refreſhing of the mind, and the waſhing of faults. Hence they may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to many things in nature, of which I ſhall inſtance onely one, of water: for as water ſerueth 1. to waſh away filthineſſe outwardly, ſo the teares of vnfained repentance to waſh away ſinne,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Waſh mee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi>) <hi>and I ſhall bee whiter then ſnow.</hi> The ſwans after they haue coupled together, doe not eate till they waſh themſelues, neither yet the Storke and Elephant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to their fellowes till they haue waſhed themſelues, much more need haue we to be waſhed with the vnfained teares of repentance 2. Waters are viuificatiue and quickening, and therefore we ſee trees which in the winter ſeeme dead, when ſpring commeth, and the water aſcendeth, doe bloſſome; ſo the mind benummed with ſinne, is by the teares of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance renewed, which otherwiſe would die, as the fiſh being out of the water. 3. As water is fruitfull wherewith the earth being watered produceth euery thing in its kind, ſo our hearts hardened in ſinne become mollified by the teares of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. This effect of water is certaine, by that ouerflowing of Nilus in Egypt. 4. As water doth comfort ſuch as are weary, both man and beaſt; ſo doe the teares of Repentance the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried &amp; troubled conſcience. 5. As water ſoftneth that which is hard, ſo the teares of repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce take away the ſecurity of Gods children, when the waters are mooued, we ſhalbe whole. 6 As water is a ſtrong fortification, as at Babylon, whoſe ſtrength (though her walls were very great) conſiſted in this, that it was compaſſed about with waters, ſo the teares of repentance doe preſerue vs againſt the ſtrength of temptation and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as by the falling of the water, the ayre becommeth puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:15287:52"/>and cleare, ſo by the teares the conſcience is clarified, for after temptation commeth a calme.</p>
                  <p>So then this weeping and mourning (required in my text by the Prophet, requiſite to be in vs at this time) doth purifie, ſtrengthen, and purge the heart of man to the performing of good workes, in ariſing from the works of darknes to a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous light.</p>
                  <p>Thus hauing ſhewed you the neceſſitie and excellency of thoſe teares, of this weeping and mourning; theſe things are alſo to be conſidered.</p>

                  <p>For the firſt, there are two kinds of teares. 1.<note place="margin">The kinds of teares.</note> Wicked teares. 2. Godly teares.</p>
                  <p>Wicked tears are falſe and counterfeit, diuelliſh and helliſh 1. I ſay the wickeds tears are falſe &amp; hypocriticall.<note place="margin">Ier. 41.6</note> Such as <hi>Ioabs</hi> when he killed <hi>Amaſa; Iſmaels,</hi> when he killed the people that came to <hi>Gedaliah: Ahabs,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was reproued by the Prophet for <hi>Naboths</hi> death: <hi>Iudas</hi> his after he betraied Chrriſt. Theſe are Crocadile teares which weepeth when ſhe hath killed a man, and by and by will doe the like. Theſe are theeuiſh and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh teares, who weepe before the Iudge, but being at liberty walke in their former courſe. 2. The wickeds teares are diuelliſh and infernall, euen ſuch as of the damned in hell, where there ſhalbe weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, which teares and mournings (ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory</hi>) are more to bee feared, then expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Godly teares are of foure ſorts. 1.<note place="margin">4. Kinds of godly teares.</note> Such as proceed from Gods children to cleere and declare their innocency, as were the teares of <hi>Ioſeph, Suſanna,</hi> and the holy Martyrs of God in the time of perſecution, whoſe teares are put in the bottle of God. 2. Such as proceed from a ſtrong and liuely ſaith in the time of affliction whereby euen Gods children are comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and refreſhed, of which <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.3.</note> 
                     <hi>My teares haue beene my meate day and night, while they haue ſaid, where is my God.</hi>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:15287:53"/>Therefore ſaith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> the Saints ſhed teares to ſee God diſhonoured: griefe troubleth the ſoule: mourning doth enlarge it: enlargement giueth it caſe. For in griefe wee ſigh, ſob, and mourne leſt the heart ſhould burſt with griefe, and in another place he ſaith, that nothing was pleaſnt vnto him, but mourning and teares. 3. The teares of brotherly loue and compaſſion: the teares which Chriſt weeped ouer <hi>Lazarus</hi> were loue-teares, whereunto euen the beaſts doe inuite vs, as the horſes and dogges of <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> did compaſſionate and lament their dead maſter.<note place="margin">Beda.</note> 4. The teares of true Repentance, ſuch as were in <hi>Peter,</hi> whoſe offence was waſhed away by his teares running downe, when his ſhame was too great to bee knowne, which ought to bee in euery one of vs, the tongue may diſſemble, but thoſe lay open the inward affections of the heart. Thoſe are eſpecially required in this place.</p>

When the Church and ſeruants of God are perſecured, Gods word is contemned, the righteous are taken away from the earth, the people are deſtroyed in their finnes: ſuch ſhould our be at this time.</p>

                  <p>Thus ye haue heard the God did require of his people (as he doth now of vs) to teſtifie their vnfained Repentance, with faſting, with weeping, and with mourning: that as formerly they had multiplied their ſinnes, they might now multiply their ſorrow for them; and as formerly they had reioyced in their ſinnes, ſo now they might weepe and mourne for the ſame; that as formerly they had pined their ſoules by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they might now abſtaine from all their former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, puniſhing their bodies with faſting, with wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and with mourning.

                  <p n="1">1. That great ſinnes require great ſorrow and lamentation. 2. That a ſorrowfull ſpirit ought to accompany a penitent heart.</p>

                  <p>For Exhortation: let vs by true ſorrow for ſinne, teſtifie our true Repentance: by this purgation we ſhall recouer health, though the paines of true Repentance exceede the paines of the body: and for this cauſe good men are ſaid to ſuffer hell in this life, yet aſſure thy ſelfe of heauen in the life to come; mourne and weepe, though God for a time delay, yet he heareth thee, and will grant thy requeſts. Our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Father I thanke thee, that thou haſt heard me:</hi> and yet at this time <hi>Lazarus</hi> was not raiſed. Marke this well, that we muſt alſo be ready to beleeue that God will grant that which wee aske as we are ready to demand and pray for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>To draw to an end: As the Lord by his Prophet required of the <hi>Iewes</hi> to turne vnto him with all their heart, with faſting, weeping and mourning, that they might preuent thoſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were threatued againſt them: ſo alſo at this time, he requireth this dutie at our hands, he requireth our tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; euen an holy reformation of our corruption, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we muſt be ſorry for euill doing, and more carefull to admoniſh others by our fals, and to preuent ſinne in our ſelues, and more wiſe to auoid the occaſions thereof. If wee finde more cheerefulneſſe in troubles, more patience in waiting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, more care to make our enemies Gods friends, taking to heart ſinnes of the time; more ſorrow for ſinne, then croſſes; if we feele an increaſe and growth of grace, with a longing deſire for our perfection in glory: theſe are certaine and vndoubted tokens of our true conuerſion vnto the Lord; which is the onely meanes to remoue thoſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which lye vpon vs, and preuent thoſe which hang oue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our heads.</p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:15287:56"/>
                  <p>For this cauſe let vs try and examine our ſelues, what wee finde within vs which may condemne vs. To this effect, let the heart which is the ſeate of the affections ſpeake to euery one or vs, or more plainely let conſcience now ſpeake boldly to all ſorts of people (for the heart is ſtill put for the conſcience amongſt the Hebrewes, they hauing no particular word for it, ſo that a pure heart, and a pure conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are equiualent tearmes, as diuers places of ſcripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme) telling them both whererein they doe amiſſe, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe what God doth require of them.</p>
                  <p>And thou, oh Conſcience,<note place="margin">What conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ought to tell.</note> that thou maieſt execute thy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice aright; ſpeake in the language of Canaan, ſpare no mans perſon, tell euery one of their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Goe vnto all Chriſtian Princes, will them to tread in the ſcope of <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> by weakning the power of Autichriſt,<note place="margin">Princes.</note> pulling downe the high places, ſpreading Leuites throughout their land to preach the word of God, that godlines may bee maintained and ſinne puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Goe vnto the Nobilitie, and tell them,<note place="margin">The Nobles.</note> that there is no true Nobility without a good conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Goe to the Counſellers, and Iudges, and ſay vnto them,<note place="margin">Iudges.</note> that Magiſtrates muſt be men of courage: fearing God, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the truth, and haters of couetouſneſſe, that they ought to abandon <hi>Balaams</hi> wages, and ſhake all bribes out of their laps.</p>
                  <p>Get thee to the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> Say,<note place="margin">The Miniſtry</note> lay hand ſuddenly on no man, bid them that they deliuer the whole counſell of God, though ſome with <hi>Demas</hi> embrace the world, and others with <hi>Iudas</hi> betray their maſter; let them cry in the eares of all men, and ſhoot the arrowes of Gods vengeance againſt the braſen faces of impenitent ſinners.</p>
                  <p>Goe to the Gentrie, tell them that Gentility conſiſteth not in cutting of a card, caſting of a die, marching of a cocke,<note place="margin">The Gentry.</note> or in hollowing after a diſmall cry of hounds, or in buying and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſpirituall liuings, but in liuing vpon their own in the feare of God.</p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:15287:57"/>
                  <p>Goe and tell Tradeſmen,<note place="margin">Tradſemen.</note> that they muſt make an equall meaſure and iuſt ballance, and that they keepe a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence abroad and at home: Let labourers take this to heart, for if the Lord did not often croſſe men in their tillage, they would euen worſhip their Ploughes.</p>
                  <p>Goe,<note place="margin">Papiſts.</note> and tell the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> that there is no true and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right conſcience kept by blowing vp Parliament houſes, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Kings, or cauſing their ſubiects to rebel againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Tell the <hi>Iewes</hi> that the Meſſiah is come,<note place="margin">Iewes.</note> in whom, if they doe not not beleeue, they cannot be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>Goe,<note place="margin">All wicked perſons.</note> terrifie all wicked perſons; tell the Swearer, that the flying Booke full of curſes ſhall light vpon him: the Sabbaoth-breaker, that there is no reſt for him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: Whoremongers, that the Lord ſhall iudge them: Murtherers, that murther cryeth to the heauens for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: Lyars, Drunkards, Gluttons, Epicures Deceiuers, &amp;c. meet with them all (for thou canſt haue acceſſe vnto them at all times) ſtrike, wound, and terrifie the whole crew of them: hunt them from lurking places, that they may be turned from their euill wayes, ere they be turned to eternall torments.</p>
                  <p>Oh, let vs in time returne vnto the Lord, before deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction come vpon vs: let vs not in this time of peace, abuſe Gods mercies, reſiſting the law of righteouſneſſe. This was the loſſe of thoſe famous Churches in <hi>Graecia,</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> this may be our lot; it may come to paſſe (and we may iuſtly feare it) that others may ſay of this Land, as we now of theirs, there were Churches, but are not now; there was the Goſpell preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but is not now. The Lord giue vs eyes that we may be wiſe in time, and repent, in that we haue fallen from our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer loue.</p>
                  <p>Be not vnthankefull for your Peace, leſt it be turned into Warre; be not proud of your benefits, leſt you be ſtripped of your ornaments be not ſecure in your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, leſt you bee put to ſorrow. Let vs all pray for true conuerſion vnto the Lord, and that our Peace may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue: Let God be our Gouernour, let the Saints dwell
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:15287:57"/>amongſt vs; let the Churches be our Courts; let the Preachers be our Councell; let Religion be our exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; let Prayers be our weapons, and Faith our ſhield, and holineſſe our armour: Let vs root ſinne out of our hearts; let vs waſh all the ſpots of euill from our liues: let vs caſt downe all the Caſtles of the Diuell in our Land; let vs driue away whatſoeuer worketh vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Thoſe are the teares which the Lord deſireth, euen ſuch as proceede from the conuerſion of the heart.</p>
                  <p>Let Prince and people, Clergie and Laitie, mourne with ſpeede, for the Lord is gone out againſt vs: weepe old men and women; weepe young men and maides; let vs all mourne, for the day of the Lord is at hand, and is come already. Therefore now turne with faſting, weeping, and mourning; let it be in greater meaſure at this time, then hath beene formerly, becauſe Gods anger is in wonderfull meaſure kindled againſt vs. Let ſorrow be our ſongs; and if we doe truely mourne, then I ſay with <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> as after a great raine, the ayre becommeth cleare and pure;<note place="margin">Sicut poſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentesimbres mundus aer ac purus efficitur, ita &amp; poſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vias ſerenitas mentis ſequitur, atque tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas.
